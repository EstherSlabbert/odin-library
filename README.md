# The Odin Project: Library project

This is my solution for the Odin Project's Library project, the specifications of which can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

By default (from the `./src/script.js` code) 3 book cards will appear on the original page with the details of each book already filled out.

This project acts as a library that displays each book on its own card, which can be edited and removed. New cards can be added by clicking the New Card button and filling out the form from the dialog.

This project currently does not have persistence.
